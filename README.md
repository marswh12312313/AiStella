## Summary
The Ai timbre model of Stella based on BERT-VITS2.
Welcome to the AiStella repository! AiStella is an innovative AI model that replicates the unique speaking style of Stella using the power of BERT for understanding context and VITS2 for speech synthesis.


## Introduction

AiStella combines the contextual understanding abilities of BERT with the state-of-the-art voice synthesis capabilities of VITS2 to create a highly realistic voice model. BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, provides a deep understanding of language nuances, which is then used by VITS2, a cutting-edge neural network for generating human-like speech, to produce a voice that not only sounds like Stella but also captures her speech mannerisms.
